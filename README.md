# Blog Preview Card

A responsive blog preview card built with HTML and CSS as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.

## The Challenge

The challenge was to build a blog preview card component that closely matches the provided design, focusing on layout, typography, spacing, and responsiveness across different screen sizes.

## Solution

I approached this challenge using a mobile-first workflow, ensuring the layout scales cleanly from smaller screens to larger displays while maintaining visual consistency with the design specifications.
